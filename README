-----------------------------

Summary:
This is a command-line Java REPL that utilizes reflection to mimic the 
    behavior of the Python interpreter. 
It compiles Java files in memory and in the same VM uses dynamic class loading 
    to bring the code back into memory to execute it.

Limitations: 
Does not accept multi-line functions.

Usage: 
java jInterp

"control+D" on UNIX (or "control+Z" on Windows) to send end-of-file to standard 
    input and exit
